# SERO mining license mechanism has been cancelled long ago



SERO public chain has cancelled the mining license mechanism since it switched to MAINNET on July 24, 2019.

Miners mining through SERO Full Node can start POW mining after completing the full node synchronization without applying for a license.


> The role of the mining license is a measure to ensure network security while the SERO BETANET network is running. Since the release of the MAINNET network (2019), SERO has reached a very high level of security under the POW+POS consensus and the mining license mechanism has been deprecated.
