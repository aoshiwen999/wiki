# Gero V1.0.5 version trading pool failure report

Time:  April 8, 2021

Reason:  Starting from 10:20 am on April 8, 2021, some SERO mining pools are experiencing the problem of only producing empty blocks without packing transactions, resulting in the accumulation of transactions in the Gero node transaction pool and the phenomenon of SERO transaction blockage.

Analysis:  Due to the optimization of the transaction pool in V1.0.5 version, it makes part of the mining pool spontaneously adjust to produce empty blocks. The problem of transaction blockage only occurs, and does not cause security problems such as double spend.

Solution:  Urgently release V1.0.7 to limit the size of pending queue and cooperate with mining pools to complete the deployment of nodes. The function of manually adjusting GasPrice will be added to the light wallet later.

Summary:  SERO, as a privacy blockchain public chain system, achieves a high level of security through POW+POS algorithm, any mining pool, POS node or individual's behavior will not lead to asset security issues.
